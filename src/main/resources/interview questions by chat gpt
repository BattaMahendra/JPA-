   - How do you manage entity states in Hibernate (transient, persistent, detached)?
   - What is the difference between `session.get()` and `session.load()`?

2. **Sessions and Transactions**
   - What is a Hibernate `Session`, and how is it used in a Spring Boot application?
   - How do you manage transactions with Hibernate in a Spring Boot application?

3. **Caching**
   - What is first-level caching in Hibernate?
   - What is second-level caching, and how do you configure it?
   - What are some common caching strategies in Hibernate?

4. **Entity Management**
   - How do you map composite keys in Hibernate? What are `@Embeddable` and `@EmbeddedId`?
   - Explain the purpose of `@Embedded` annotation.

5. **Performance and Optimization**
   - What are common performance issues with Hibernate and how can you address them?
   - How do you handle lazy loading in Hibernate, and what are its pitfalls?

6. **Scenario-Based Questions**
   - You are facing `LazyInitializationException` errors. How would you resolve this issue?
   - How would you address `StaleObjectStateException` in a concurrent update scenario?

### Connection Pooling (HikariCP)

1. **Basic Concepts**
   - What is connection pooling, and why is it crucial in a Spring Boot application?
   - Explain how HikariCP works and its advantages over other connection pools.

2. **Configuration**
   - How do you configure HikariCP in `application.properties` or `application.yml`?
   - What are some key properties of HikariCP, and what do they control?

3. **Performance and Optimization**
   - How does connection pooling improve application performance?
   - What are common issues with connection pools, and how can you troubleshoot them?

4. **Scenario-Based Questions**
   - Your application is experiencing high latency and frequent database connection issues. How would you diagnose and resolve these problems?
   - How would you configure HikariCP to handle a high volume of transactions with minimal latency?

### Multiple Databases Configuration

1. **Configuration**
   - How do you configure multiple data sources in a Spring Boot application?
   - Explain how to set up multiple `DataSource` beans and configure them in `application.properties` or `application.yml`.
   - What is the role of `AbstractRoutingDataSource` in managing multiple data sources?

2. **Routing and Management**
   - How can you route database operations to different data sources based on the use case?
   - Describe how you can use `@Primary` and `@Qualifier` annotations for managing multiple data sources.

3. **Scenario-Based Questions**
