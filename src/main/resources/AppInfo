Hibernate is a popular Java-based Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework that simplifies database interaction in Java applications.
 However, like any other technology, Hibernate comes with its own set of challenges, one of which is the N+1 problem.
 In this blog post, we’ll dive into what the N+1 problem is, why it occurs, and how to resolve it with Java code examples

What is the N+1 Problem in Hibernate?
The N+1 problem is a performance issue that occurs when fetching data from a relational database using Hibernate.
It gets its name from the way it manifests: for each entity fetched, an additional query is executed to fetch its associated entities.
This can quickly lead to a large number of queries being executed, resulting in poor application performance.

Let’s illustrate this problem with an example. Suppose you have two entities: Author and Book, with a one-to-many relationship where one author can have multiple books.
 If you retrieve a list of authors and then iterate through each author to access their books, Hibernate will generate a separate SQL query for each author's books.
 This results in N+1 queries, where N is the number of authors.

Why Does the N+1 Problem Occur?
The N+1 problem occurs because of Hibernate’s default fetching strategy.
 By default, Hibernate uses lazy loading for associations, which means that associated entities are loaded only when they are accessed.
  This behavior helps reduce unnecessary data retrieval, but it can lead to the N+1 problem when not used strategically.

How to Resolve the N+1 Problem
To resolve the N+1 problem in Hibernate, you can employ several strategies, including:

Eager Fetching : You can change the fetching strategy to eager loading for specific associations using annotations or XML configuration.
This ensures that associated entities are loaded along with the main entity in a single query.

@OneToMany(fetch = FetchType.EAGER)
@JoinColumn(name = "author_id")
private List<Book> books;
Fetch Joins:Use the JOIN FETCH clause in your HQL (Hibernate Query Language)
or JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language) queries to fetch associated entities eagerly.

String hql = "SELECT a FROM Author a JOIN FETCH a.books";
List<Author> authors = entityManager.createQuery(hql, Author.class).getResultList();
Batch Fetching : Implement batch fetching to retrieve multiple entities in a single query.
This can be done using Hibernate-specific features like @BatchSize.

@BatchSize(size = 10)
private List<Book> books;
Subselect Fetching : Subselect fetching is another strategy in Hibernate to address the N+1 problem. It allows you to fetch associated entities using subselect queries, which can be particularly useful when you want to load related data lazily but still avoid the N+1 query issue.

@OneToMany(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
@Fetch(FetchMode.SUBSELECT)
@JoinColumn(name = "author_id")
private List<Book> books;

Lazy loading vs eager loading

When to use what?

The basic parameter that we use to judge between each strategy is that we need to limit the number of queries to the server.

It is a good idea to use Eager Loading when the relations are not too much.
 Thus, Eager Loading is a good practice to reduce further queries on the Server.
Use Eager Loading when you are sure that you will be using related entities with the main entity everywhere.
Use Lazy Loading when you are using one-to-many collections.
Use Lazy Loading when you are sure that you are not using related entities instantly.
